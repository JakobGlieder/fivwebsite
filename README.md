# Vue.js Converter App
![screenshot of the app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfectoOne/Vue-Converter-Example-App/master/screenshot.jpg)
An example of a Vue.js app which utilizes all of the basic elements of Vue.js : two way data-binding, vue loops, custom events, computed properties, single file components (.vue files), props etc.

This example is suitable as a demonstration of how all those elements look like "in an actual app" for new vue developers.

## Now running live!

## Starting the app
This app was created using the vue command line (vue-cli). If you are not familiar with the vue-cli yet and you wanna play around with this app, here's the basic procedure to get you started:  

1. Download and install Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/  
2. Open your command line and download the vue-cli NPM package by running the following command: `npm install -g @vue/cli`  
3. Download or clone this repository  
4. Open the command line again and switch to the directory where you have downloaded this repository (run the command `cd [path of the folder where you downloaded this repository]` )  
5. Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies (not all of them are necessary for this app, but they are nevertheless listed in the `package.json` file
5. Run the command `npm run serve`.  
6. Wait a little bit...  
7. Open up your web browser and type in `localhost:8080` in the address bar. The app should be up and running!

PS: Any changes you make to the code while the app is running are going to be reflected to the running app automatically (no need to restart anything).
